<p>Throughout each chapter we'll be writing tests using RSpec, Capybara and a few
other tools. If you've read books like <a href="https://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in
Action</a> (https://manning.com/bigg2), then you'll be
familiar with this kind of testing[^1_5]. If you haven't read that, then it should
be easy enough for you to pick up after the first couple of tests.</p>
<p>[^1_5]: And hopefully this kind of writing style too :)</p>
