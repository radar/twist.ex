Throughout each chapter we'll be writing tests using RSpec, Capybara and a few
other tools. If you've read books like [Rails 4 in
Action](https://manning.com/bigg2) (https://manning.com/bigg2), then you'll be
familiar with this kind of testing[^1_5]. If you haven't read that, then it should
be easy enough for you to pick up after the first couple of tests.

[^1_5]: And hopefully this kind of writing style too :)
